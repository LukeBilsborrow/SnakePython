# Card Game Project

This project was created for the "Advanced Programming with C++" module at UCLan, where it achieved a grade of 100/100.

## Overview

This project is a card game developed as part of a university assignment. For simplicity, the game simulates card moves without user interaction, with moves being randomly generated and displayed in text format.

## Project Description

The main focus of the assignment was to demonstrate proficiency in C++ programming, particularly in the areas of smart pointers and object-oriented programming (OOP). The project adheres to strict guidelines, with no raw pointers allowed.  
The card game serves as a practical application to showcase the use of smart pointers and the implementation of inheritance and OOP principles.  
There was also a very strict naming guide provided which is why the use of these conventions in this project may seem over the top.  
The project features a well-structured architecture, emphasizing modularity and adherence to best practices. However, due to time constraints, there may be some hacks and unfinished parts that require further polishing.

## Compiling

This project is intended to be compiled against C++20  
After compiling, ensure the files from the resources folder are in the same directory as your exe.

## Notes

- This project was developed within the scope of a university assignment and may not be fully optimized or polished for production use.
