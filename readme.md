# Snake Game Implementation in Python

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Snake game. The project is part of a larger initiative to implement the same game across multiple programming languages, showcasing different approaches and techniques in each language.
Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a simple game can be consistently implemented across different languages using a pseudocode design. This approach highlights the core logic and structure of the game while allowing for language-specific optimizations and idiomatic code.
About This Version

This repository features the Python version of the Snake game, focusing on core Python programming practices and game development techniques. The game is designed to be language and library-agnostic, ensuring that the main logic can be easily understood and adapted to other environments.
